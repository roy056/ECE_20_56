# Discussion:
Git is a version control system that helps to track changes in our code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a platform that hosts our Git repositories online, making it easier to share and work on projects with others. We use Git on our local machine to manage our code, and then push our changes to GitHub to collaborate and keep everything in sync.
