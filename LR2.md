# Experiment no: 2
# Experiment Name: Best Coding Practices
# Objective:
* Define what naming conventions are and their importance in coding.
* Discuss common conventions like camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and kebab-case.
# Source code and output:
# Naming Conventions:
there are mainly 4 types of naming conventions in industry:
- Camel Case.
- Snake Case.
- Kebab Case.
- Pascal Case.

## Camel Case:
In camel case, you start a name with a small letter. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with a capital letter:
ex: `firstName, lastName`

## Snake Case:
Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words.
ex: `first_name, last_name`

## Kebab Case:
Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (_) to separate the words.
ex: `first-name, last-name`

## Pascal Case:
pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.
ex: `FirstName, LastName`
# Discussion:
Naming conventions in programming are guidelines that help developers choose clear and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities in their code. These conventions improve readability and maintainability by ensuring that names are descriptive and self-explanatory.By following these conventions, developers can reduce errors, make their code easier to understand, and facilitate smoother collaboration and maintenance.
